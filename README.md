The purpose of this code is to couple PEST++ and PSDDF to better predict soil consolidation and help inform the placement of fine grain soils in coastal environments. PEST++ is "a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis". PSDDF is a 1-D consolidation finite difference software that predicts the temporal change in surface elevation of placed fine grained soils. To do this, PSDDF requires soil property data from lab and field testing. However, getting accurate measurments of soil properties can be difficult. PEST++ enables testing to be done to determine how sensitive PSDDF is to soil input properties and allows PSDDF to be used in an inversion problem. For example if a coastal design requires a certain final surface elevation that information can be provided to this coupled software and be used to determine a placement strategy.
